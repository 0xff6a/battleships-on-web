Week 5 @ Makers Academy: Web Based Battle Ships
===============================================

Extending the previous battleships application to function as a web app. Code had to be modified extensively to simplify the classes and transfer a number of responsabilities to the game class to fit a web-based game flow.

Styled in CSS and deployed to Heroku.
